# Highly optimized CUDA implementation of k-means algorithm

A novel, highly-optimized CUDA implementation of k-means algorithm. The approach documented in **Detailed Analysis and Optimization of CUDA K-means Algorithm** paper which was accepted to ICPP'20 conference (publishing in progress).

The repository currently holds the [experimental code](../../tree/master/experimental) used for measurements and all our [measured results](../../tree/master/results).

Although the kernels may be used for further experiments, the code is not immediately ready to be used as library... but we are working on that.

## Rules of Utilization
