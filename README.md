# Highly optimized CUDA implementation of k-means algorithm

A novell, highly-optimized CUDA implementation of k-means algorithm. The approach was published at ICPP'20 conference.

The repository currently holds the experimental code used for measurements and all our measured results.

Although the kernels may be used for further experiments, the code is not directly ready to be used as library... but we are working on that.
